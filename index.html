                </h1>
                <p>Matcha Powder is a unique type of tea made from whole green tea leaves. Before harvest, the plant is
                    kept shaded from the sun. This gives the leaves an incredibly vibrant emerald color. The process of
                    grinding the whole leaf into a fine powder yields a stronger flavor profile.

                                I love to use matcha in its traditional form, as well as tons of baking recipes! It’s
                                also amazing in face masks to soothe sensitive skin. Definitely one of my health
                                favorites! </p>
